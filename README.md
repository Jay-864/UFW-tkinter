# UFW-tkinter
A Python-based graphical user interface for managing UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on Linux systems using tkinter.

Tested on Arch-linux. Following are the required packages:<br><br>
**sudo** : for root privileges<br>
**python** : since the project is written in it<br>
**tk** : tkinter library required for gui<br>
**ufw** : commandline firewall<br><br>
**Note**: This is a prototype project and may cause unexpected issues or disrupt your firewall settings. Use with caution and at your own risk. It is recommended to back up your current firewall configuration before using this tool.
